          <h1>What we do</h1>
      
          <p>Some call us sellswords.  We prefer to think of ourselves as a scalable private army.  We provide security, justice or power, as needed.  We can be a force multiplier for an existing army or provide all the manpower you need for specific raids, defenses or special projects.</p>
      
          <p>We can travel anywhere in the seven kingdoms and beyond.</p>

        <h1>Who we are</h1>

        <p>We are experienced soldiers, mercenaries, spies, assassins, traders (and even a few disgraced knights).  Our people come from various backgrounds, but all have significant experience and go through a rigorous training process to assure quality.  All of our soldiers and mercenaries have been battle-tested, as have many of our other ranks.  You outline the project and we can suggest a force composed of the right men and women for the job.</p>
        
        <p>Our management has held positions of command in the armies of lords and kings, with hundreds of years of battle planning and prosecution among them.  They can handle the logistics, staging and front-line leadership necessary to a successful project.  We are all certified in project management and all of management are fluent in the common tongue.</p>
        
        <p>Please note that we are no longer affiliated with Harry Strickland's Golden Company of Essos.</p>

        <h1>Become a client!</h1>
      
        <p>It's easy!  Just enter your email address below and a member of our client team will contact you to talk about your needs and how we might help.  Our terms are flexible - prices are typically based on time billed to a project (with hourly rates based upon the experience and skillsets of the personnel involved as well as the risk of the project), but for certain projects, we will work on contingency for a share of the proceeds.  We think you'll find our prices reasonable for the experience, expertise and results we can provide.</p>

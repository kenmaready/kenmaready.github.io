          <h1>Introduction</h1>
        </header>
        <p><strong>pandas</strong> is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language. It is already well on its way toward this goal.</p>
        <p>pandas is well suited for many different kinds of data:
          <ul>
            <li>Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet</li>
            <li>Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data</li>
            <li>Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and column labels</li>
            <li>Data imported from a .csv (comma-separated values) or .xslx (excel) file
            <li>Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data actually need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data structure</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

          <h1>Data Structures</h1>
        </header>
        <p>The two primary data structures of pandas, <strong>Series</strong> (1-dimensional) and <strong>DataFrame</strong> (2-dimensional), handle the vast majority of typical use cases in finance, statistics, social science, and many areas of engineering. For R users, DataFrame provides everything that R’s data.frame provides and much more. pandas is built on top of NumPy and is intended to integrate well within a scientific computing environment with many other 3rd party libraries.</p>
          <p>We’ll start with a quick, non-comprehensive overview of the fundamental data structures in pandas to get you started. The fundamental behavior about data types, indexing, and axis labeling / alignment apply across all of the objects. To get started, import NumPy and load pandas into your namespace:</p>
          <div class="code-block">
            <code>
              <p>>> import numpy as np</p>
              <p>>> import pandas as pd</p>
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>We’ll give a brief intro to the data structures, then consider all of the broad categories of functionality and methods in separate sections.</p>
          <h2>Series</h2>
        <p>A <strong>Series</strong> is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type (integers, strings, floating point numbers, Python objects, etc.). The axis labels are collectively referred to as the index. The basic method to create a Series is to call:</p>
          <div class="code-block">
            <code>
              <p>>> s = pd.Series(data, index=index)</p>
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>where s is the variable name for the new Series, data can be any one of a number of python data structures (lists, numpy array, scalar, etc.), and index is a list of index labels.</p>
        <h2>DataFrames</h2>
        <p>A <strong>DataFrame</strong> is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. You can think of it like a spreadsheet or SQL table, or a dict of Series objects. It is generally the most commonly used pandas object. A DataFrame can be created out of many types of data collections, including lists, series, arrays, etc.  Pandas provides easy means to create DataFrames from data in other file (e.g., a csv file or an excel file).</p>
        <p>A basic method to create a DataFrame is:</p>
        <div class="code-block">
          <code>
            <p>>> data2 = [{'a': 1, 'b': 2}, {'a': 5, 'b': 10, 'c': 20}]</p>
            <p>>> df = pd.Series(data2, index=index)</p>
          </code>
        </div>
        <p>The resulting DataFrame (df) would be a table of 3 columns ('a', 'b' and 'c') with the first row (titled '0' by default) containing the values 1, 2 and NaN (for 'Not a Number'), and the second row (titled '1') containing the values 5, 10 and 20.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Creating_DataFrames_From_Files">
        <header>
          <h1>Creating DataFrames From Files</h1>
        </header>
        <p>As mentioned above in the Data Structures section, pandas provides easy methods for importing data from outside sources directly into a DataFrame structure. Often, data will be in a .csv (comma-separated values) or an .xls (excel) file. For these, the pandas.read_csv() and pandas.read_excel() methods make it easy to import the data directly into a DataFrame structure.</p>
        <p>The call is fairly straightforward -- for example:</p>
        <div class="code-block">
          <code>
            <p>>> df = pd.read_csv('mydatafile.csv', index_col='Date')</p>
          </code>
        </div>
        <p>This example reads all the data in from a .csv file called 'mydatafile.csv' and puts it into a DataFrame named df, using the "Date" column from the file as the index for the new DataFrame.  The method is very flexible and provides a lot of useful optional parameters so that you can select only certain columns, certain rows, rename the columns, set the value you want in your DataFrame to replace NaN values, etc.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Saving_Data_To_Files">
        <header>
          <h1>Saving Data to Files</h1>
        </header>
        <p>Pandas also makes it easy to <em>export</em> data from a DataFrame to filetypes commonly used for data.  For example, the flipside of the .from_csv() and .from_excel() methods are to_csv() and to_excel().  As a simple example, in order to save the DataFrame <em>df</em> that we created from a csv file above:</p>
        <div class="code-block">
          <code>
            <p>>> df = pd.to_excel('myexcelfile.xslx')</p>
          </code>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Visualizing_Data">
        <header>
          <h1>Visualizing Data</h1>
        </header>
        <p>In order to allow for easy visualization, pandas 'plays nice with' matplotlib.  For many of the matplotlib methods, pandas provides a similar method (typically using the same naming conventions), with the pandas method being a 'wrapper' providing enhanced functionality with pandas data structures.  For example, in order to plot the data in all the columns of a DataFrame in a line plot, one only has to use the pandas version of the .plot() function:</p>
        <div class="code-block">
          <code>
            <p>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt</p>
            <br>
            <p>>> # create DataFrame df with time series data</p>
            <p>>> # and columns 'A', 'B', 'C' and 'D'</p>
            <p>>> df.plot()</p>
            <p>>> plt.show()</p>
          </code>
        </div>
